A simple app that displays a list of sensors availabe on your Android device on one tab, and a list of x, y, and z acceleration from the 
accelerometer sensor in a second tab.  
The project has two modules:
* app: Kotlin version
* java: Java version

Feel free to contact me in case you have any suggestions/comments/feedback for improvement.
